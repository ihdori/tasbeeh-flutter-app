# tasbeeh app
### State managment: [Riverpod ^2](https://riverpod.dev/)

The "Tasbeeh" application is designed to assist in counting daily tasbeeh (acts of glorification) in its various forms. Currently, there are three sections for tasbeeh:

## The first section: Tasbeeh of Lady Fatimah.
## The second section: Daily Dhikr 
where the user selects the day and the displayed "dhikr" changes accordingly in the designated field.
## The third section: Custom Dhikr.
In this section, the user adds the desired count, and the application calculates the total count, with an option to reset the count if desired by the user.
